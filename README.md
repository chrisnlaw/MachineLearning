## MachineLearning
 
4th Year of engineer school project, the goal of the project is to make a predictive analysis to prevent the resignation of employees using python and Machine Learning Algortithm

## Prerequisites

-You will find The database on the Dataset Folder.

-You will need The database and Python(v2.7). 

## Algorithm

the implemented algorithms will be:

-KNN (K-nearest neighbors)

-SVM ( Support Vector Machine)

-Random Forest

-Logistic Regression

## HTML-Interface

python code that generate a semi-dynamic interface that summup the project and the results .
By changing the features of the trainig set you will get different plots and results in the interface .
You will be able to play with the dataset (change the number of features or the features ..) to optimize the results and test others options .

Python libraries: dominate
